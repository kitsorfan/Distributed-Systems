Classes

Node 
a single node of our 5 VM cluster
Contains:
- id: id number of node
- wallet(subclass): used to specify transactions 
- blockchain: chain of blocks
- valid_trans: validated transactions by the node 
- pending_trans: non-validated transactions by the node
- unreceived_trans: transactions broadcasted to the node
- ring: information about every node (ip_address, port, public_key)

Wallet
every node corresponds to a wallet
- public key: used as the address of the wallet
- private key: used to create signatures
- utxos: unspent transactions 


Block
a single block of the node blockchain
Contains:
- index: number of block inside the node chain
- previous_hash: hash of the previous block (SHA256 encryption method is used)
- transactions: list of transactions of the block
- timestamp: creation time
- nonce: used to enforce proof of work
All blocks have a certain transactions capacity.


Blockchain:
the list-chain of blocks


Transaction:
information of a transaction
- sender: public key of sender
- receiver: public key of receiver
- senderID: sender's ID in the cluster 
- receiverID: receiver's ID in the cluster
- amount: amount of NBC shared 
- id: id number of node
- transaction_inputs: ids from previous transactions were gains appeared
- transaction_outputs: receiver's NBC gains and sender's change 
- signature: private key of sender


rest:
rest API commands for communication
